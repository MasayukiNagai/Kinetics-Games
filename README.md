## Description
Kinetics Games are analogy to chemical kinetics and designed to easily understand its mechanisms. This program handles a basic kinetic reactions A →　B and the progress of the reactinons including monomolecular, bimolecular, catalytic, autocatalytic, consecutive, and equilibrium reactions. 

## Rules

* Insted of using actual molecules, we assume a container which contains equal-sized balls, A and B, and stores information as colors
* We put our hand into the container and draw ball(s) blindly and successively. Every selected ball is identified visuallyas an A-ball or a B-ball
* When a reaction happens, a drawn ball is replaced by ball of the opposite color taken from stock
