            <li>Instead of actual molecules, we have one container which contains equal-sized balls, A and B, and stores information as colors (A = blue, B = red)</li>
            <li>We put our hand into the container and draw ball(s) blindly and successively. Every selected ball is identified visually as an A-ball or a B-ball</li>
            <li>When a reaction happens, a drawn ball is replaced by ball of the opposite color taken from stock</li>
            <li><b>A, B, X: </b>represent the initial numbers of each ball</li>
            <li><b>Time: </b>represetnts how many times you draw ball(s) from a box</li>
            <li><b>Probability: </b>represents a probability that a reaction will occur after drawing ball(s)</li>
            <li><b>Repeats: </b>represents how many times you repeat a simulation</li>
