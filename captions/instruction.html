            <li>Instead of actual molecules, we have one container which contains equal-sized balls, A and B, and stores information as colors (A = blue, B = red).</li>
            <li>We put our hand into the container and draw ball(s) blindly and successively. Every selected ball is identified visually as an A-ball or a B-bal.l</li>
            <li>When a reaction happens, a drawn ball is replaced by a ball of the opposite color taken from stock.</li>
            <li>In addition to A and B, X-balls can be added. They represent other molecules, such as solvent, that are not involved with the reaction. Thus, adding more X-balls means the less concentrated solution.</li>
            <li>In the "Games" tabs, you see the following paramters in the sidepanel:</li>
            <ul class = "params-lists" style = "font-size:20px">
                <li><b>Type of Reaction: </b>A reaction mechanism you want to simulate</li>
                <li><b>A, B, X: </b>The initial numbers of each ball</li>
                <li><b>Time: </b>The number of times you draw ball(s) from a box</li>
                <li><b>Probability: </b>A probability that the reaction will occur after drawing a ball</li>
                <li><b>Repeats: </b>The number of times you repeat the whole simulation</li>
